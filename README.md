I originally made this in Processing and then later translated it to Javascript, so there are 2 separate versions here.
Processing one tends to run faster and smoother.  GIF is from the Javascript version (demo at https://www.mronan.com/projects/mystify/mystify.html )

These stills are from the Processing version:
